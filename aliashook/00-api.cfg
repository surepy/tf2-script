// 00-api.cfg <https://github.com/surepy/tf2-script>
// this is a modified version of Julianacat*s aliashook. 
// i didnt like some of the features, and how it spammed console.
// and i wanted to customize it, too.
// * also (more) known as oneechanhax (or Onee, for short). probably in a different alias now.

// original comment:
/// ~~Julianacats~~ very own stupidly advanced scripts.		

/// The following set of scripts were made quite a long time ago by myself. They are built		
/// to provide the user with many options in-game to change the scripts functionality.

/// The scripts are also heavily commented for easy understanding on what part does what.		
/// Many things can be simplified down and made more lightweight, but also have already had 		
/// harsh optimazations from previous iterations. They have been re-written with the the			
/// intention of solving the previous scripts bugs as well as customization from other people	
/// other than myself.

/// The previous iteration had everything in own cfg file to be execed the intent was it would	
/// be easy for them to speak to each other, having everything in once place with a strict layout
/// would be great for easily connecting parts of the script together without jumping			
/// inbetween files. There is also no need to seperate scripts due to not needing compiliation.

/// Uses a debug mode to tell the user, some info on the corner of the screen
/// I have Heavealy implemented this into my scripts, it is a MUST for those willing to use my scripts.				
/// It is THE backbone to most of my things allowing scripts wanting to give info to the user, and easy way to to that				
/// while not allowing another command to disable the hud before the last command has time to be read by the user.
					
/// How it works: When you call a hudOnAli(then some number) then it disables every hudOffAli(then some number)			
/// except the one with the number that called the hudOnAli in the first place.
